# Architecture — trackeros

## Overview

The architecture is modular, with a clear separation of concerns between models, repositories, services, controllers, and routes. The backend is built using Fastify for performance, while the frontend leverages React Native for mobile and React for web, sharing contracts for type safety.

## Stack

- Runtime: Node 20 LTS
- Package manager: npm
- Test framework: Jest
- Backend: Fastify
- Frontend: React Native
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Module structure

```
src/modules/leave/leave.{model,repository,service,controller,routes}.ts
src/modules/balance/balance.{model,repository,service,controller,routes}.ts
src/modules/employee/employee.{model,repository,service,controller,routes}.ts
src/modules/policy/policy.{model,repository,service,controller,routes}.ts
src/modules/notification/notification.{model,repository,service,controller,routes}.ts
src/modules/LeaveStatus/    — LeaveStatus module
src/modules/BaseEntity/    — BaseEntity module
src/modules/LeaveRequest/    — LeaveRequest module
src/modules/LeaveType/    — LeaveType module
src/modules/LeavePolicy/    — LeavePolicy module
src/modules/AuditLog/    — AuditLog module
src/modules/AuditRecord/    — AuditRecord module
src/modules/AuditServiceInterface/    — AuditServiceInterface module
src/shared/db connection.ts
src/shared/base repository.ts
src/shared/error types.ts
```

## Key patterns

- See `AGENTS.md` for stack-specific coding conventions
- See `docs/GOLDEN_PRINCIPLES.md` for the non-negotiable rules every
  cycle is checked against

## Dependency rules

- Modules import from each other ONLY through their declared public
  entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, package root — whatever the
  stack uses)
- All database access goes through a repository layer — no inline SQL
  / ORM calls in route handlers or business logic
- No circular dependencies between modules

## Leave Management Module — Reconciled Architecture

### Stack
TypeScript 20, Fastify, PostgreSQL, modular monolith, Jest. Frontend React Native is out of scope for this backend module.

### Canonical naming decisions
- EmployeeRole: EMPLOYEE | MANAGER | ADMIN (replaces hr_admin).
- LeaveTypeCode: ANNUAL | SICK | EMERGENCY (drops unpaid/maternity/paternity).
- EmploymentStatus: ACTIVE | TERMINATED | ON_LEAVE (drops INACTIVE).
- AuditRecord is canonicalized as AuditLog.
- LeaveType is a first-class entity with its own table and module.

### Domain entities and lifecycle states
- Employee: ACTIVE, TERMINATED, ON_LEAVE.
- LeaveType: ACTIVE, ARCHIVED.
- LeaveRequest: DRAFT, SUBMITTED, APPROVED, REJECTED, CANCELLED.
- LeaveBalance: OPEN, CLOSED.
- LeavePolicy: DRAFT, ACTIVE, SUPERSEDED.
- AuditLog: RECORDED.
- Notification: PENDING, SENT, READ, ARCHIVED.

### Key business rules
- requestedDays = endDate - startDate + 1 (inclusive calendar days) is the single canonical day-count derivation.
- Sufficiency check: entitledDays - usedDays - pendingDays >= requestedDays.
- Reservation lifecycle: submit increments pendingDays; approve decrements pendingDays and increments usedDays; reject/cancel decrements pendingDays only.
- Approval authorization: MANAGER or ADMIN only, no self-approval, approver must be requester's manager or ADMIN.
- Notice: startDate >= today + minNoticeDays (calendar), EMERGENCY exempt.
- Max duration: requestedDays <= maxConsecutiveDays and <= maxRequestDays.
- Every state-changing operation writes an AuditLog.

### Conceptual tables
employees, leave_types, leave_policies, leave_requests, leave_balances, notifications, audit_logs. No SQL DDL; code agent generates migrations.

### Modules
shared-types, shared-db, shared-errors, employee, leave-type, policy, audit, notification, balance, validation, leave.

### Dependency direction
leave is the sole orchestrator and depends on balance, validation, policy, employee, audit, notification, leave-type, and shared foundations. No module depends back on leave.

### Phases
1 Shared foundations; 2 employee/leave-type/policy; 3 audit/notification; 4 balance; 5 validation; 6 leave.

### Cross-cutting contracts
- Auth: JWT bearer; request.user { id, role: EMPLOYEE|MANAGER|ADMIN }; requireRole guard; no self-approval.
- Error: { error, code }; 400/401/403/404/409.
- Transaction: service-owned IUnitOfWork.withTransaction; repositories accept optional PoolClient; BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK only in PgUnitOfWork.

### Open questions
Day-count calendar vs business days; accrual model; carry-forward cap; migration mechanism; controller layer; BullMQ for notifications.
