# Golden Principles — trackeros

These invariants are non-negotiable. Violations produce
`GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH` signals and pause the cycle for human review —
they are never auto-resolved by the platform.

Stylistic rules and architectural conventions (no-any, no-direct-db,
no-hardcoded-secrets, etc.) live in `HARNESS.json` under
`constraints.rules` and produce `CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION` signals that the
platform can auto-retry. The six principles below are the ones that
get a human in the loop.

## GP-001 — Repository pattern

All database access goes through repository interfaces.
Never query the database directly from services or controllers.

## GP-002 — Audit records

All state-changing operations write an audit record.

## GP-003 — Input validation

Validate all inputs at API boundaries before processing.

## GP-004 — No sensitive data in logs

Never log passwords, tokens, PII, or financial data.

## GP-005 — RBAC enforcement

All API endpoints enforce role-based access control.

## GP-006 — Error handling

No unhandled promise rejections. All async errors are caught and handled.
