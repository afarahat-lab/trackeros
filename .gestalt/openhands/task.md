# Fix specific quality-gate violations: Phase 9: LeaveRequestService

You are an autonomous coding agent working INSIDE an already-cloned git repository at `/tmp/gestalt/fix/73542714-9897-4d99-9509-1a7bb9190c33/9/2`. Do not clone anything; work only in this directory.

You are fixing SPECIFIC violations the quality gate found in EXISTING, already-committed files. Make the targeted edits listed below — do NOT refactor, regenerate, or change unrelated code.

The files ALREADY EXIST. You MUST edit them in place with the `str_replace_editor` tool. Reading or viewing a file is NOT sufficient — you have NOT finished until you have edited EVERY file listed below.

## Project constraints (NON-NEGOTIABLE — the gate enforces these; satisfy them now)
Your code MUST obey every rule below. These are not style preferences — the quality gate rejects the phase on any violation, so comply up front:
- Use unknown with type guards instead of any (rule: `no-any`)
- Database calls must go through repository pattern (rule: `no-direct-db-outside-repository`)
- No hardcoded passwords, API keys, or tokens (rule: `no-hardcoded-secrets`)
- Do not add @gestalt/* packages as project dependencies — these are Gestalt platform internals not available on npm (rule: `no-gestalt-internal-deps`)

## Binding architecture rules (operator decisions — NON-NEGOTIABLE, apply everywhere)
These are resolved, feature-wide decisions. Wherever this phase touches the concept a rule names, implement it EXACTLY as stated — do not re-derive, re-interpret, or apply it in one place and omit it in another:
- Business policy answers for the leave management module:

1/7. Fiscal (leave) year: CALENDAR YEAR (Jan 1 to Dec 31), organisation-wide, keyed off the leave startDate. Not a configurable fiscal year, not hire-date anniversary.

2. Cross-fiscal-year request (e.g. Dec to Jan): deduct the WHOLE request from a single fiscal year — the fiscal year of startDate. Do not split across years.

3. Accrual: full entitlement granted UPFRONT at the start of the fiscal year (annual lump-sum), not accrued over time. Mid-year hires: pro-rate the first year by the whole months remaining from the hire date (rounded down).

4/8. Carryover + balance: USE-IT-OR-LOSE-IT — unused days do NOT carry over across fiscal years (no carryover limit needed). Balance: available = entitled - (used + pending). Deduct on APPROVAL (on submission the days are held as PENDING/reservation; on approval pending -> used; on reject/cancel release the reservation).

5/9. Manager resolution + employee data: the LeaveRequest service obtains employee data (managerId, employmentStatus, hireDate) via an IEmployeeRepository interface (dependency-injected), backed by an employees table — the SAME repository-interface pattern the other modules use. The JWT / request context provides ONLY the caller identity (employeeId) and role for RBAC; the manager relationship, hire date, and employment status are looked up via IEmployeeRepository (do NOT read them from the JWT). Approvals/notifications route to the target employees managerId; if managerId is null, escalate to HR (a user with role hr_admin). Managers may act only on their direct reports.

6. Day counting: BUSINESS/WORKING DAYS only — exclude weekends (Sat/Sun) and public holidays. Both startDate and endDate are INCLUSIVE. WHOLE DAYS ONLY — no half-days (a half-day request is not supported; minimum 1 day).

Cross-cutting rules throughout:
- Overlapping leave requests are prevented (reject a new SUBMITTED/APPROVED request overlapping an existing SUBMITTED/APPROVED one for the same employee).
- Balances auto-created for all leave types on employee creation.
- Emergency leave is a SEPARATE pool (distinct from annual/sick) and bypasses the advance-notice requirement, but still requires approval and deducts from its own balance.
- Every endpoint enforces RBAC (employees on their own records; managers approve/reject direct reports) plus input validation.
- Only ACTIVE employees may submit leave. [BINDING RULE — operator decision resolving: How is the fiscal year determined for LeaveBalance assignment? Is it calendar year (Jan 1 – Dec 31), a company-specific fiscal year (e.g., Apr 1 – Mar 31), or configurable per policy?; What happens when a LeaveRequest spans two fiscal years (e.g., startDate in December, endDate in January)?; How does accrual work for annual leave? Is the full entitlement granted upfront at the start of the fiscal year, or does it accrue over time?; Do unused leave days carry over to the next fiscal year, and if so, up to what limit?; How is an employee's manager resolved for routing approvals and notifications?; How are leave days counted for balance deduction — calendar days (inclusive start..end) or working/business days? Does a half-day leave consume 0.5 or 1 day?; What defines the fiscal_year boundary for leave balances — calendar year, a configurable fiscal year (e.g. Apr–Mar), or employee hire-date anniversary?; How is leave balance computed — simple remaining = allocated - used, or does it involve accrual rules (e.g. pro-rata monthly accrual, carry-over from prior year)?; How is an employee's manager resolved? The LeaveRequest service needs a managerId for routing approvals and notifications.; apply everywhere these apply, not in one place only]

## Architecture & constraint rules the quality gate enforces (satisfy these now)
The quality gate judges your code against the rules below and BLOCKS the phase on any violation — a violation it rates critical escalates to a human with no automatic retry. These are the same rules the gate checks, so comply up front rather than leaving them for the gate:
- Data access is only permitted in the designated data access layer of this project. Code in business logic, presentation, or routing layers must delegate all data operations to the data access layer.
- The data access layer is the only layer permitted to contain connection management, query execution, and direct interaction with the data store.
- Each architectural layer communicates only with its immediately adjacent layer. Layers must not bypass intermediate layers.
- Dependencies flow in one direction only — from outer layers toward inner layers. Inner layers must not depend on outer layers.
- Error handling must be explicit. Callers must not be exposed to unhandled failures from dependencies.
- Do not redefine a symbol another module already owns. Before declaring an error class, DTO, interface, enum, or constant, check whether a symbol representing the SAME concept is already exported by another module; if so, import it from that module's public entry point instead of declaring a second copy. The test is conceptual identity, NOT name identity — a symbol that shares a name but represents a genuinely DIFFERENT concept (different fields or meaning, owned by THIS module) is a legitimately distinct declaration and is not a violation; only flag a declaration that duplicates the shape and meaning of an existing exported symbol.

## Module boundary & dependency rules (satisfy these now)
The quality gate's review judges your code against the project's cross-module dependency rules below and BLOCKS the phase on a violation. These govern how modules depend on each other: import another module ONLY through its declared public entry point (its barrel / index) — never reach into another module's internal files — and introduce no circular dependencies. Comply now rather than leaving them for the gate:
- Modules import from each other ONLY through their declared public entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, package root — whatever the stack uses)
- No circular dependencies between modules

## Golden principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE — satisfy every one that applies)
These are the project's non-negotiable invariants. A violation is a GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH: the quality gate BLOCKS the phase and escalates to a human with NO automatic retry, so it is far more costly than an ordinary finding. Apply EVERY principle relevant to the code you write in this phase — e.g. enforce role-based access control on every API endpoint you add, and validate all inputs at API boundaries before use:
- GP-001 — Repository pattern: All database access goes through repository interfaces. Never query the database directly from services or controllers.
- GP-002 — Audit records: All state-changing operations write an audit record.
- GP-003 — Input validation: Validate all inputs at API boundaries before processing.
- GP-004 — No sensitive data in logs: Never log passwords, tokens, PII, or financial data.
- GP-005 — RBAC enforcement: All API endpoints enforce role-based access control.
- GP-006 — Error handling: No unhandled promise rejections. All async errors are caught and handled.

## Project stack & references
Before making the edits below, read the referenced files (those present in the working directory) to learn the project's architecture, conventions, and the cross-cutting rules your fix must still satisfy — then keep the edits consistent with them:
- `HARNESS.json`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/GOLDEN_PRINCIPLES.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `PLAN.md`

## Required edits

### Coherent change 1 — apply as ONE atomic edit across ALL sites below

Unifying change (do this now): Remove direct usage of pg Pool/PoolClient (pool.connect, client.query BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK) from LeaveRequestService.approve and .cancel; perform all persistence and transactional state transitions through the injected ILeaveRequestRepository (and other injected repositories) so unit tests with mocked dependencies pass without a real database connection.

The sites below are the SAME underlying issue. Fixing some but not others leaves the code incoherent and the quality gate WILL re-flag it — apply the one change above consistently to EVERY site:

- Site 1
File: src/modules/leave-request/leave-request.service.ts
Line: 149
Rule violated: test-failure
Action (do this now): Edit `src/modules/leave-request/leave-request.service.ts` at line 149 in place to fix the `test-failure` violation.
What the quality gate found — apply this: Failing test: LeaveRequestService › approve › allows approval when managerId is null (HR escalation).

- Site 2
File: src/modules/leave-request/leave-request.service.ts
Line: 280
Rule violated: test-failure
Action (do this now): Edit `src/modules/leave-request/leave-request.service.ts` at line 280 in place to fix the `test-failure` violation.
What the quality gate found — apply this: Failing test: LeaveRequestService › cancel › cancels an approved leave request and releases balance.

Then check the rest of these files (and the surrounding module) for ANY OTHER occurrence of the same pattern beyond the specific lines listed above, and apply the same change there too — do NOT limit the fix to only the enumerated sites.

### Coherent change 2 — apply as ONE atomic edit across ALL sites below

Unifying change (do this now): Fix the minimum-notice validation in LeaveRequestService.submit so it aligns with the business-day rule and the unit-test fixtures: compute notice using the same day-counting basis the tests expect (and ensure emergency leave bypasses it), so submit proceeds to the balance/business-day logic instead of throwing for the business-day-counting, cross-fiscal-year, and audit-resilience test cases.

The sites below are the SAME underlying issue. Fixing some but not others leaves the code incoherent and the quality gate WILL re-flag it — apply the one change above consistently to EVERY site:

- Site 1
File: src/modules/leave-request/leave-request.service.ts
Line: 76
Rule violated: test-failure
Action (do this now): Edit `src/modules/leave-request/leave-request.service.ts` at line 76 in place to fix the `test-failure` violation.
What the quality gate found — apply this: Failing test: LeaveRequestService › business day counting › counts business days excluding weekends.

- Site 2
File: tests/unit/modules/leave-request/leave-request.service.test.ts
Line: 625
Rule violated: test-failure
Action (do this now): Edit `tests/unit/modules/leave-request/leave-request.service.test.ts` at line 625 in place to fix the `test-failure` violation.
What the quality gate found — apply this: Failing test: LeaveRequestService › cross-fiscal-year requests › uses fiscal year of startDate for balance deduction. expect(jest.fn()).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...expected) Expected: "emp-001", "annual", 2026

Then check the rest of these files (and the surrounding module) for ANY OTHER occurrence of the same pattern beyond the specific lines listed above, and apply the same change there too — do NOT limit the fix to only the enumerated sites.

## Verify before you finish (MANDATORY)
After making the edits above, the code MUST still compile and its tests MUST pass — a compilation/type error, or a test your change breaks, must NEVER be left for CI or the quality gate to find. Before you declare this task done:
- Read the project's build / type-check / test commands from `package.json` (scripts) and `HARNESS.json`, install dependencies if they are not already installed, then RUN the type-check / build (e.g. `npm run build` or `tsc --noEmit`) AND the tests (e.g. `npm test`).
- FIX every compilation error, type error, and failing test that YOUR edits introduced — including updating a test whose expectation your change legitimately invalidated (e.g. a new required field, a new status code such as 401/403 from an added authorization check, added input validation) — and re-run until they pass.
- Only when the build and the tests pass may you consider the task complete. If a dependency install genuinely cannot be made to work, say so explicitly in your final message rather than declaring success on unverified code.

## Constraints (mandatory)
- Keep the change SURGICAL: make the required edits above and fix only what they broke (compile/type errors and the tests they invalidated). Do NOT refactor, regenerate, or change unrelated code, and do not add / delete / rename source files beyond what a required edit — or a test-fix for it — needs.
- Do NOT run `git commit`, `git push`, `git add`, or any git command. The platform handles all git operations. (Running the build / type-check / tests above is expected and encouraged — that is NOT a git operation.)
- When the listed edits are made and the build + tests pass, stop.
