# Fix specific quality-gate violations: Phase 3 — Notification module (~3 files)

You are an autonomous coding agent working INSIDE an already-cloned git repository at `/tmp/gestalt/fix/dd1a6d9f-1b67-4054-9579-5cb7ccee58f3/5/1`. Do not clone anything; work only in this directory.

You are fixing SPECIFIC violations the quality gate found in EXISTING, already-committed files. Make the targeted edits listed below — do NOT refactor, regenerate, or change unrelated code.

The files ALREADY EXIST. You MUST edit them in place with the `str_replace_editor` tool. Reading or viewing a file is NOT sufficient — you have NOT finished until you have edited EVERY file listed below.

## Constraints & consistency
You CHOOSE the implementation shape (files, types, routes, components). It MUST satisfy EVERY item below — these are requirements, not suggestions.
### Reuse & consistency — match these exactly
- Reuse the existing ValidationError class (code VALIDATION_ERROR, statusCode 400) rather than introducing a new error type. (see `src/shared/types/errors.ts`)
- Match the existing Notification entity field types (relatedEntityType/relatedEntityId: string | null) and NotificationInput optional-plus-nullable shape; do not change the model. (see `src/modules/notification/notification.model.ts`)
- Preserve the existing notify behavior for valid inputs (id generation, createdAt at write time, status PENDING, readAt null, client passthrough to repository.create). (see `src/modules/notification/notification.service.ts`)
### Entity invariants — enforce these
- Reuse or extend `Notification`: relatedEntityType and relatedEntityId are always both null or both non-null — a Notification never carries a partially-set related-entity pair.
### Interface contract — expose these operations (their shape is yours)
- NotificationService.notify — Rejects input where exactly one of relatedEntityType/relatedEntityId is provided by throwing ValidationError (VALIDATION_ERROR, 400) before persisting; otherwise persists and returns the Notification.

## Authoritative entity shape (from the reconciled architecture — MANDATORY, not your choice)
The entities below are shared, cross-module DATA CONTRACTS. Implement each one with EXACTLY these fields and types — identical names and types, with no additions, renames, splits (e.g. do NOT split a `fullName` into first/last), or omissions. This is a fixed contract other modules and later phases depend on; it is NOT an implementation choice, and it OVERRIDES any field list you might infer from PLAN.md or the phase description:
- `Notification` — the entity MUST have exactly these fields:
    - id: string
    - recipientId: string
    - type: string
    - title: string
    - message: string
    - relatedEntityType: string | null
    - relatedEntityId: string | null
    - status: 'PENDING' | 'SENT' | 'READ' | 'ARCHIVED'
    - createdAt: Date
    - readAt: Date | null

## Project constraints (NON-NEGOTIABLE — the gate enforces these; satisfy them now)
Your code MUST obey every rule below. These are not style preferences — the quality gate rejects the phase on any violation, so comply up front:
- Use unknown with type guards instead of any (rule: `no-any`)
- Database calls must go through repository pattern (rule: `no-direct-db-outside-repository`)
- No hardcoded passwords, API keys, or tokens (rule: `no-hardcoded-secrets`)
- Do not add @gestalt/* packages as project dependencies — these are Gestalt platform internals not available on npm (rule: `no-gestalt-internal-deps`)

## Binding architecture rules (operator decisions — NON-NEGOTIABLE, apply everywhere)
These are resolved, feature-wide decisions. Wherever this phase touches the concept a rule names, implement it EXACTLY as stated — do not re-derive, re-interpret, or apply it in one place and omit it in another:
- CONSOLIDATED DECISION — binding for every phase of this feature.

1 — LEAVE DAY COUNT = CALENDAR DAYS, INCLUSIVE OF BOTH ENDS:
days = endDate - startDate + 1. Do NOT exclude weekends. Do NOT exclude public holidays.
There is no holiday calendar in scope for this feature.
Implement this EXACTLY ONCE as a single shared exported helper (e.g.
countLeaveDays(startDate, endDate)) in the leave domain module, and call that helper from
EVERY site needing a day count: balance deduction on APPROVED, restoration on CANCELLED, the
sufficiency check before approval, entitlement comparison, and minimumNoticeDays enforcement.
No call site may re-derive the count inline — inline re-derivation is the anti-pattern this
decision exists to prevent.

2 — THERE IS NO FISCAL YEAR. The leave year IS the CALENDAR year: 1 January to 31 December.
Balances reset on 1 January. Do NOT implement a configurable fiscal-year start month and do
NOT implement employee-anniversary years (the latter would need hire dates this feature does
not own). Store the year as a plain integer (e.g. 2026) on the balance record.
NO CARRY-OVER AND NO ACCRUAL: the full annual entitlement is available from 1 January, and
unused days simply EXPIRE at 31 December — they do not roll over, there is no monthly or
pro-rata accrual, no carry-over cap and no expiry-deadline logic. On 1 January a fresh balance
row is created for the new year with usedDays = 0 and pendingDays = 0. Mid-year joiners
receive the FULL entitlement (no proration).

3 — SEPARATE BALANCES PER LEAVE TYPE, and ALL types require manager approval.
Annual, sick and emergency each get their OWN LeavePolicy entitlement and their OWN
LeaveBalance record. Emergency leave does NOT draw from the annual pool; its default
entitlement is 5 days. Model all three uniformly — no special-casing of any type anywhere in
the balance logic.
Every type goes through the SAME approval lifecycle: PENDING -> APPROVED | REJECTED, and
PENDING | APPROVED -> CANCELLED. There is no auto-approving type and no post-hoc approval path.
NO documentation requirement for sick leave: do NOT add a PENDING_DOCUMENTATION state and do
NOT add any document-tracking entity.

4 — A REQUEST IS NEVER SPLIT ACROSS TWO YEARS. A request whose [startDate, endDate] range
crosses 31 December is charged IN FULL to the balance year of its startDate. Do not split the
day count between two balance records, do not create a second linked request, and do not
reject it for crossing the boundary. Derive the balance year from startDate, once.

BALANCE COUNTER SEMANTICS (binding, and the reason remainingDays is never stored):
The balance record holds three non-negative integer counters — entitlementDays, usedDays,
pendingDays — and availability is ALWAYS derived, never stored:
    availableDays = entitlementDays - usedDays - pendingDays
The ONLY permitted writes:
- SUBMIT a request for n days:  pendingDays += n   (reserve; usedDays unchanged)
- APPROVE it:                   pendingDays -= n, usedDays += n
- REJECT a PENDING request:     pendingDays -= n   (release)
- CANCEL a PENDING request:     pendingDays -= n   (release)
- CANCEL an APPROVED request:   usedDays -= n      (restore)
No counter may go negative; a transition that would take one below zero is an ERROR, not a
clamp. The sufficiency check before approval is n <= availableDays.

TRANSACTIONS: every operation that changes a LeaveRequest status AND balance counters AND
writes an audit record must run all three through the SAME unit-of-work client in ONE
transaction, so a failure rolls back all three. Repository AND service methods that
participate take the client as an OPTIONAL LAST parameter and pass it through; when omitted
they use the shared pool. Negative guards live in ONE place (the balance service) and are
never duplicated into callers.

OVERLAP: no overlapping APPROVED leave for the same employee, enforced at APPROVAL time (not
submission) in the same place as the sufficiency check. Overlap = any intersection of the
[startDate, endDate] range with an existing APPROVED request, regardless of leave type. [BINDING RULE — operator decision resolving: Should leave duration be measured in calendar days or business (working) days, and should weekends/public holidays be excluded from the count?; How is the fiscal year boundary defined for balance accrual and carry-over, and is unused annual leave carried over or forfeited?; Should sick and emergency leave be deducted from the same annual entitlement pool or tracked as separate balances, and do they require manager approval?; Can a leave request span multiple fiscal years, and if so how is the duration split across the two balances?; What is the rounding direction and precision for remaining_days when entitlement is fractional (accrual_rate present) or when used_days is fractional?; How is the fiscal year boundary defined for balance accrual and carry-over (e.g. calendar year Jan 1–Dec 31 vs. a company-specific fiscal year), and is unused annual leave carried over or forfeited?; How are leave days counted when computing used_days and remaining_days (e.g. inclusive vs exclusive of end_date, half-day support, weekend/holiday exclusion, rounding direction)?; How are leave days counted for a request spanning partial days or weekends/holidays?; How is the fiscal year derived for a leave request?; What is the rounding rule for partial-day balances (e.g. half-day leave)?; apply everywhere these apply, not in one place only]

## Architecture & constraint rules the quality gate enforces (satisfy these now)
The quality gate judges your code against the rules below and BLOCKS the phase on any violation — a violation it rates critical escalates to a human with no automatic retry. These are the same rules the gate checks, so comply up front rather than leaving them for the gate:
- Data access is only permitted in the designated data access layer of this project. Code in business logic, presentation, or routing layers must delegate all data operations to the data access layer.
- The data access layer is the only layer permitted to contain connection management, query execution, and direct interaction with the data store.
- Each architectural layer communicates only with its immediately adjacent layer. Layers must not bypass intermediate layers.
- Dependencies flow in one direction only — from outer layers toward inner layers. Inner layers must not depend on outer layers.
- Error handling must be explicit. Callers must not be exposed to unhandled failures from dependencies.
- Do not redefine a symbol another module already owns. Before declaring an error class, DTO, interface, enum, or constant, check whether a symbol representing the SAME concept is already exported by another module; if so, import it from that module's public entry point instead of declaring a second copy. The test is conceptual identity, NOT name identity — a symbol that shares a name but represents a genuinely DIFFERENT concept (different fields or meaning, owned by THIS module) is a legitimately distinct declaration and is not a violation; only flag a declaration that duplicates the shape and meaning of an existing exported symbol.

## Module boundary & dependency rules (satisfy these now)
The quality gate's review judges your code against the project's cross-module dependency rules below and BLOCKS the phase on a violation. These govern how modules depend on each other: import another module ONLY through its declared public entry point (its barrel / index) — never reach into another module's internal files — and introduce no circular dependencies. Comply now rather than leaving them for the gate:
- Modules import from each other ONLY through their declared public entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, package root — whatever the stack uses)
- No circular dependencies between modules

## Golden principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE — satisfy every one that applies)
These are the project's non-negotiable invariants. A violation is a GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH: the quality gate BLOCKS the phase and escalates to a human with NO automatic retry, so it is far more costly than an ordinary finding. Apply EVERY principle relevant to the code you write in this phase — e.g. enforce role-based access control on every API endpoint you add, and validate all inputs at API boundaries before use:
- GP-001 — Repository pattern: All database access goes through repository interfaces. Never query the database directly from services or controllers.
- GP-002 — Audit records: All state-changing operations write an audit record.
- GP-003 — Input validation: Validate all inputs at API boundaries before processing.
- GP-004 — No sensitive data in logs: Never log passwords, tokens, PII, or financial data.
- GP-005 — RBAC enforcement: All API endpoints enforce role-based access control.
- GP-006 — Error handling: No unhandled promise rejections. All async errors are caught and handled.

## Project stack & references
Before making the edits below, read the referenced files (those present in the working directory) to learn the project's architecture, conventions, and the cross-cutting rules your fix must still satisfy — then keep the edits consistent with them:
- `HARNESS.json`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/GOLDEN_PRINCIPLES.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `PLAN.md`

## Required edits

### Edit 1
File: src/modules/notification/notification.service.ts
Line: 31
Offending code: `relatedEntityType: input.relatedEntityType ?? null,`
Rule violated: review/architecture
Action (do this now): Edit `src/modules/notification/notification.service.ts` at line 31 in place to fix the `review/architecture` violation.
What the quality gate found — apply this: [review/architecture] The entity invariant requires relatedEntityType and relatedEntityId to be "either both present or both null; they are never partially set." The service coerces each field independently with `?? null`, so a caller passing only one of the two (e.g. relatedEntityType='LeaveRequest' with no relatedEntityId) produces a partially-set Notification (relatedEntityType='LeaveRequest', relatedEntityId=null), violating the invariant. The success criteria ask for independent null coercion, but the stated entity invariant is not enforced.

## Verify before you finish (MANDATORY)
After making the edits above, the code MUST still compile and its tests MUST pass — a compilation/type error, or a test your change breaks, must NEVER be left for CI or the quality gate to find. Before you declare this task done:
- Read the project's build / type-check / test commands from `package.json` (scripts) and `HARNESS.json`, install dependencies if they are not already installed, then RUN the type-check / build (e.g. `npm run build` or `tsc --noEmit`) AND the tests (e.g. `npm test`).
- FIX every compilation error, type error, and failing test that YOUR edits introduced — including updating a test whose expectation your change legitimately invalidated (e.g. a new required field, a new status code such as 401/403 from an added authorization check, added input validation) — and re-run until they pass.
- Only when the build and the tests pass may you consider the task complete. If a dependency install genuinely cannot be made to work, say so explicitly in your final message rather than declaring success on unverified code.

## Constraints (mandatory)
- Keep the change SURGICAL: make the required edits above and fix only what they broke (compile/type errors and the tests they invalidated). Do NOT refactor, regenerate, or change unrelated code, and do not add / delete / rename source files beyond what a required edit — or a test-fix for it — needs.
- Do NOT run `git commit`, `git push`, `git add`, or any git command. The platform handles all git operations. (Running the build / type-check / tests above is expected and encouraged — that is NOT a git operation.)
- When the listed edits are made and the build + tests pass, stop.
